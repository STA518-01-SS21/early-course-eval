I also think Github has been kind of confusing in troubleshooting errors and Im not always finding the information I need to troubleshoot whenever I run into a problem.",I think I really need to maybe work on preparations before I try to do learning target checks or projects because sometimes I think the learning targets and projects require more knowledge or practice before being able to answer the questions which I don't feel I have.  I often find that im spending so much time searching for code that works to answer the question that I loose track of time and can't meet the deadline of the learning target check.  I think its become really frustrating for me as a learner to try to meet the pace but I haven't quite given up yet.,"what kind of questions do you like us asking you as the instructor? This is something that is really hard for me to gauge I think because I know I should know the coding better, but even if I understand the problem Im not comfortable enough with the coding to make sure I have done it right to answer the question. So I often don't know if the question im asking can be found in the resources we are already given or if I need to do more searching.  Most often I feel I know what needs to be done to tidy the data but I need to figure out whats the best process out of what we have learned to do it, and Im not sure I have done a good job of it as yet."

With things like the gender pay gap and college major earnings, I am actually motivated to create my own visualizations and explore the data myself.","I think that more examples of troubleshooting that includes a mock process of googling and looking through R4DS would be helpful. 
Another thing that would be helpful is recorded tutorial videos",Watch more YouTube videos on R and play around with data in R in my free time.,"It is hard to pinpoint one thing that I would change, but I think that the course would benefit from more guided activities. The Rstudio primers seem to give me a good understanding when I do the preparations, but once I get into the activities or projects themselves, I have an extremely hard time figuring out what to do. I get that this is what coding always entails (figuring out how to get the desired output), but R seems to be just very hard to learn for someone who is new to it. This course relies on the student to know (and/or figure out) how to teach themselves coding. 
I think another thing that would be helpful are optional recorded lecture videos that would use the functions that we have covered. The teaching in the live sessions are great, but more focused and comprehensive recorded videos would be much better in my opinion. Aside from the Rstudio primers, there is no exposure to the actual process of coding aside from doing that activities and projects. This is good in its own way because I learn how to figure things out myself, but I often feel that there are much better ways of figuring things out than the way I have been doing."
